Basic Buffer Usage
Using a Buffer to read and write data typically follows this little 4-step process:

Write data into the Buffer
Call buffer.flip()
Read data out of the Buffer
Call buffer.clear() or buffer.compact()
When you write data into a buffer, the buffer keeps track of how much data you have written. Once you need to read the data, you need to switch the buffer from writing mode into reading mode using the flip() method call. In reading mode the buffer lets you read all the data written into the buffer.

Once you have read all the data, you need to clear the buffer, to make it ready for writing again. You can do this in two ways: By calling clear() or by calling compact(). The clear() method clears the whole buffer. The compact() method only clears the data which you have already read. Any unread data is moved to the beginning of the buffer, and data will now be written into the buffer after the unread data.
